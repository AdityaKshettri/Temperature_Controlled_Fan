# Temperature_Controlled_Fan
The main aim of this project is to calculate and monitor the surrounding temperature and change the speed of the fan as temperature changes i.e. the speed should increase with a rise in temperature and should decrease with a drop in temperature. The temperature would be displayed through the LCD which is interfaced by the 8051 microcontroller. The FAN is controlled by a PWM wave given to it by the microcontroller, the power given to the fan is lesser in low temperature and greater in high temperature.
